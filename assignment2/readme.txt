## Execution Instruction

Before running *Gomoku.py*, reset the python path to a valid path to python3. For instance,

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
#/usr/local/bin/python3
```

## Assumptions and Explanations

1. In the public test case 80, the answer should be [draw G3] only. Please refer to [this post](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1134500).

## Acknowledgement
